## History of Server Side Javascript & Node

- Node was introduced in 2011 by Ryan Dahl
- Built ontop of Google's V8 runtime (also offered on Chakra)
- C++ bindings makeup the greater part of the NodeJS stdlib
- Allows for general purpose programming
- Great for I/O heavy applications

---

## Strengths & Weaknesses of NodeJs

---

### Weaknesses

- Single threaded\*
  - \*applications must be designed to operate in clusters
- Slower than most other languages
- Javascript is dynamically typed; 
  - more prone to sloppy code and trivial errors
  - use typescript
- stdlib lacks in many ways, encourages the use of NPM
- NPM
  - code from these packages are sometimes questionable
  - huge attack vector


---

### Strengths

- Asynchronous by nature; 
  - great for I/O driven applications (servers)
- Full stack web applications now in Javascript
  - great for MVPs and prototyping
  - increases productivity, less context switching for devs
  - faster dev time promoting iterative feedback loops early
- Thriving package ecosystem via Node Package Manager (npm)
- Allows for Server Side Rendered SPA's
- NPM
  - there is a module for everything

# A Tour of Node

<CodeSurfer>

```ts title="stdlib http server" file="../1.0-stdlib-http/src/index.ts"
```

```diff 5:19

```

## Adding middleware

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts title="middleware app" subtitle="./app.ts" file="../1.1-with-middleware/src/app.ts"
```

```ts 5:28 file="../1.1-with-middleware/src/app.ts"
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```ts 9:33 title="stdlib http server with middleware" subtitle="./index.ts" file="../1.1-with-middleware/src/index.ts"
```

</CodeSurfer>

# Using Express

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="express hello world" file="../2.0-express/src/index.ts"
```

```diff 7:22

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Async Patterns

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js 13:38 title="Callbacks" file="../2.1-express-async-patterns/src/routes/1-weatherCallbacks.js"
```

```diff 16:38 subtitle="callback 'hell'"

```

</CodeSurfer>

## Fullstack Javascript

---

### Server Side Single Page Applications
- Node allows for hybrid web applications
  - Client side SPA's can now be used on the server
- Initial render is done on the server
  - HTML markup is sent to the client and rehydrated
- This method works with any modern framework
  - React, Angular, Vue, etc.

---

### SSR Architecture 
- Do not build monolithic SSR applications
- SSR nodes should be treated as a service
  - "Render as a service"
- Decouple your data to its own dedicated API service
- Data access should always be over http - _even on the server_

---

## SSR Demo

```
goto "3.0-express-api-server"
goto "3.1-ssr-react"
```

---

## Scaling Node
Clusters & Threading

---

### Clusters
- A cluster consists of forked node processes
- The pool of node workers share a single port
- The main proc distributes load using a round robin approach
- All applications should be designed to horizontally scale

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="cluster example"  file="../4.0-scaling/src/cluster.ts"
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Threading
- Similar to clusters with a more general API
- Useful for performing *CPU* intensive operations
- Do not use for I/O operations
  - Instead stick with regular Asynchronous patterns

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="threading example"  file="../4.0-scaling/src/threading.ts"
```

</CodeSurfer>
